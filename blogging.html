    <p>What I like about Blogging:<br>
        Anyone can make one:<br>
        For better or worse, anyone can write a blog post about anything they want. Everyone has a voice and the best voices will rise to the top.<br>
        
        The writer can show their personality:<br>
        In blog posts, the writer has more leeway to add in their voice and personality than other types of writing.<br>
        
        Blogs are a great form of mass communication:<br>
        You can help people, learn new things, entertain your audience—the possibilities are endless and amazing. Blogging opens up all of these to a very wide audience.<br>
        
        You can make money:<br>
        Get the right blog going and you can make a lot of money through advertising and sponsored posts.<br>
        
        It allows people to craft better thoughts:<br>
        Instead of reading haphazard, uneducated Facebook statuses, it’s much better to see people’s thought process in a well-written blog post.<br>
        
        You can establish a community:<br>
        Blogging allows you to connect with other individuals who share the same interests. Sharing ideas and opinions within your community helps establish yourself as a thought leader.<br>
        
        Good for SEO:<br>
        Keeping content on your site fresh and relevant, you can use your blog to boost the search engine ranking (SEO) of your site and your business.<br>
        
        It brings people back to your site:<br>
        If your blog is strong enough and updated regularly, people will come back looking for more and bring traffic back to your site as well.<br>
        
        It’s free:<br>
        It costs you a grand total of zero dollars to post to the blog, so if you have something to say, there’s nothing to stop you.<br>
        
        You can establish yourself as a thought leader:<br>
        A blog is a great place for your original thoughts, and it can be a wonderful way to show off your individuality. If people like your ideas, you can become a thought leader in your industry!
