    <p>What I like about Driving:<br>

        1. The feeling of control:
        I can literally steer my way through life; wherever I want, for those few hours (of course, barring accidents). I control how the car behaves and how I react to situations around me. I don't think life is that simple, but when I'm driving, it IS that simple.<br>
        
        2. A different kind of interaction with your fellow men:
        Car to car interaction is way different than face to face interaction. Somehow when you're on the road, all social/economic differences go out the window. We're all out there, doing our thing, trying to get somewhere carrying on with our awesome/miserable lives; all the while interacting with one another.<br>
        
        3. The beautiful scenery:
        There are some really beautiful places here in Michigan (the Upper Peninsula for instance). I can drive, I can pull over and absorb the nature around me, take pictures and move on.<br>
        
        4. "Me" time:
        Ok, I need to be driving alone for this one! And usually a fairly long distance too.. when I'm driving on a clear, fairly straight freeway on cruise control, I can usually zone off and "think". Just random stuff. It could be of relevance, could be not, doesn't matter! I can think and reflect, and often solve problems during those so called "time wasted driving". I love it, it's great!<br>
        
        5. Vulnerability:
        I understand I could get hit and injure myself or die any moment. It's scary to think about it and I know we all do, but it's something that needs to be done regardless. It's like a life lesson. (Sometimes I go out for a drive just for the heck of it, lucky me to have that time)<br>
        
        6. Discipline:
        I understand that I can cause chaos and hurt or kill someone if I'm not attentive. It's a big responsibility and I always remind myself and constantly am respectful and courteous to other drivers; regardless of how bad my day/week/month is! Another great life lesson!<br>
        
        7. Patience:
        There are always going to be people who will break the rules and just in general, piss you off, a lot sometimes! Doesn't entitle me to act like an a$$hole though! I would be endangering other innocent people, can't do that! And another life lesson.<br>
        
        8. Tread softly when times are tough:
        This specifically refers to driving in winter conditions. Man, everything you learned about driving has to be turned down a couple notches; hit the gas? Gently.. hit the brakes? Gently.. taking a sharp turn? Gently.. if you make an abrupt move (loss of patience), you'll probably end up in a ditch (or worse!) The immense amount of patience it teaches me is unparalleled! This actually makes me enjoy driving even more when spring comes around.</p>
